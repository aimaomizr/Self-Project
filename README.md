# Web-Based Child Health Risk Prediction System
Children under the age of five are more susceptible to diseases. 6.3 million children
die each year and more than half of deaths are due to lack of early prevention or early
treatment. This thesis presents the results of my investigation on children health risks.
Based on these results, I design and implement a new health risk system for children
under five years old. Parents can upload data of their children. Then the system can
evaluate the current growth and development status, identify unhealthy habits, predict
potential chronic disease, report health related factors (e.g. vaccination coverage) in the
nearby environments and finally provide personalized solutions to prevent health risks
as early as possible. Compared to a well known health-care system, eRedBook, which
is mainly used for recording and managing child health data, the proposed system
focuses on risk evaluation and prediction as well as alerting and providing personalized
solutions.
