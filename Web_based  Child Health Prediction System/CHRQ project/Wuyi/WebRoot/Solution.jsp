  Get plenty of sleep. Research suggests that growing teenagers and pre-teens need between 8.5 and 11 hours of sleep every night. This is because your body grows and regenerates tissue while you're at rest. Make your sleeping environment as calm as possible, and try to eliminate loud noises and unnecessary light. If you have trouble falling asleep, try taking a warm bath or drinking a hot cup of chamomile tea before bed.
The human growth hormone (HGH) is produced naturally in our bodies, especially during deep or slow wave sleep.[6] Getting good, sound sleep will encourage the production of HGH, which is created in the pituitary gland.
As a hormone, HGH is sometimes injected into the bloodstream under supervision of a licensed doctor. HGH creams, powders, pills or non-prescription injections are medically suspect and can have serious side effects.[7] Talk with your doctor before starting any course of HGH treatment.

  Eat right. Ensuring that you're getting all the vitamins and minerals your body requires will help you grow to your full height. Take a supplement targeted at your age group with breakfast each morning, and try to incorporate certain foods into your diet. Here are some specific suggestions:
Make sure to take in an abundance of carbohydrates and calories for that is where the body gains its energy to grow.
Get plenty of calcium (found in dairy products and green vegetables). Calcium promotes bone growth, and can help prevent osteoporosis.
Taking 500 mg of niacin has shown to significantly increase growth hormone levels only when taken on an empty stomach.[8]
Get sufficient vitamin D (which can be obtained through eating fish, alfalfa, or mushrooms, or spending enough time in the sun). Vitamin D promotes bone and muscle growth in children[9], and a deficiency has been shown to stunt growth and cause weight gain in teenage girls. If you don't like fish, consider a purified fish oil supplement (purifying removes mercury).
Take in lots of protein (from meat, eggs, tofu or legumes). Proteins provide an essential building block your body needs in order to grow. At least one (preferably two) of your meals each day should include a high quality protein.
Up your zinc intake (oysters, chocolate, peanuts, eggs, peas, asparagus and supplements). A zinc deficiency can cause stunted growth in children [10]. The best way to make sure you meet your body's daily need is by taking a vitamin or supplement that includes zinc.
Eat on a regular schedule. You should be eating 3 meals a day, with small snacks between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner. Try to schedule these events at roughly the same time each day.

Keep your immune system strong. Some childhood illnesses can stunt your growth. Most of them can be avoided by the routine immunizations you may have had as a baby, but stay on the safe side by ingesting plenty of Vitamin C (found in citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruits and lemons) and getting plenty of rest as soon as you notice that you feel sick.
Keep your immune system strong by eating whole, fresh foods. Try to avoid processed foods, foods with empty calories or high levels of fat, and hydrogenated foods, such as margarine or shortening.
Eat a wide variety of healthy foods. Eating one thing such as açaí or salmon for every meal, while not harmful, doesn't do all that much to keep your immune system at its strongest. Eat a variety of fruits, plenty vegetables, whole grains, protein sources such as milk, cheese, nuts and fish, and other foods rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids for a healthier immune system.

    Exercise your body. Sadly, if your growth plates have closed as due to your age, exercising will not affect your growth rate.[11] But if you enjoy swimming, biking, running, or yoga, among other sports, and you haven't stopped growing, exercise combined with the right diet and proper sleep should help you grow.
Doing stretches has some beneficial effects. There are tons of "grow taller" exercises on the Internet, which claim to help you grow. As mentioned above, after your growth plates have closed, you will not grow taller. Therefore, there's no scientific evidence to suggest you can grow taller through stretching. Stretching may improve your posture, which can exaggerate how tall you are — or de-emphasize how small you are — but it cannot add inches to your frame.
